# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We value your contributions and want to make the process as smooth as possible. This document outlines the necessary steps and guidelines to help you contribute effectively.

## Contribution Steps

1. **Branching**:
   - Create feature branches from the 'master' branch, considering the target deployment.
   - Use the naming convention `[feat/update/fix/]SVA-...`, aligning with the corresponding Jira ticket, if it exists.

2. **Commit Messages**:
   - Include `SVA-[Ticket-Number]` at the bottom of the commit message description, if a Jira ticket exists.

3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
   - **Description**: Provide a comprehensive description, including supporting images if applicable.
   - **Assignees**: Assign yourself to the PR.
   - **Reviewers**: Select two colleagues for peer review.
   - **Labels**: Attach relevant labels to categorize the PR.

4. **Jira Integration** (if you have access):
   - Assign the appropriate category (e.g., 'Internal Review').
   - Select a reviewer.
   - Set a due date.
   - Add comments for additional context and clarification.
